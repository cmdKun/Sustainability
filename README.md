Hi, I'm Malek Alatawi, and this is my project, Go Green, aimed to aware people for the imprtance of sustability.

I designed the website using HTML and CSS, with natural colors to create a greener, more eco-friendly style.

Since I'm not an expert in CSS, I struggled with some design ideas, including the last part of the website. After searching through CSS documents I learned some tricks and techniques to do it.
